title: "Distributing Python programs with PyInstaller"
draft: false
---

You can start making distributions of your game from the moment it runs.
There are multiple tools to do this with, but this example will use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

This assumes you have a project started with a `main.py` script, and that all your data assets are in a directory called `data`.

First you need to install [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) using pip.
You can do this with the command: `pip install pyinstaller`

`/build.spec` is the result of modifying a `.spec` file automatically generated by PyInstaller.

```python
# -*- mode: python ; coding: utf-8 -*-
# https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec-files.html
block_cipher = None
PROJECT_NAME = "roguelike_tutorial"

a = Analysis(
    ["main.py"],
    binaries=[],
    datas=[("data", "data")],  # Include all files in the 'data' directory.
    hiddenimports=[],
    hookspath=[],
    runtime_hooks=[],
    excludes=[],
    win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
    win_private_assemblies=False,
    cipher=block_cipher,
    noarchive=False,
)
pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data, cipher=block_cipher)
exe = EXE(
    pyz,
    a.scripts,
    [],
    exclude_binaries=True,
    name=PROJECT_NAME,  # Name of the executable.
    debug=False,
    bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    console=True,  # Set to False to disable the Windows terminal.
    icon="icon.ico",  # Windows icon file.
)
coll = COLLECT(
    exe,
    a.binaries,
    a.zipfiles,
    a.datas,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    upx_exclude=[],
    name=PROJECT_NAME,  # Name of the distribution directory.
)
```

`pathex` has been removed to make this configuration portable.
You can build a project using this `spec` file with the command `pyinstaller build.spec`.
You can then run the executable at `dist/roguelike_tutorial/roguelike_tutorial.exe`.

`PROJECT_NAME` is setup as a convenient way to set the project name.
This will affect the executable name and the distribution directory name.

`datas=[("data", "data")]` will copy all files from the data directory (first `"data"`) to the data directory of the distribution (second `"data"`.)

An `icon` is optional and that line can be deleted, otherwise `icon.ico` can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TStand90/tcod_tutorial_v2/fd2364dbf184ea83f571c96110dc35c5349ade1d/icon.ico) and put in the project directory.

This has been setup for all parts of the 2021 tutorial.
