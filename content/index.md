To get started with the old version of the TCOD tutorial, [click here](/tutorials/tcod/2019/).

To try out the new version, [click here](/tutorials/tcod/v2/). The new version will be updated weekly to coincide with the 2020 [RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/grccvt/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) event.
